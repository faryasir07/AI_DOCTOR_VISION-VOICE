# ü©∫ AI Doctor with Vision and Voice

An experimental multimodal AI assistant that acts like a **virtual doctor** ‚Äî capable of analyzing **images of any body part**, understanding **spoken symptoms**, and responding in **natural spoken language**.

This project explores the potential of combining **LLMs**, **Computer Vision**, and **Speech Interfaces** to deliver **accessible AI healthcare interactions**.

‚úÖ Upload any body part image (e.g., face, skin, wound, eye, etc.)  
‚úÖ Speak your symptoms using a microphone  
‚úÖ Get a concise, human-style spoken diagnosis  
‚úÖ Two voice synthesis options: **gTTS** (Google) & **ElevenLabs**  
‚úÖ Modular code structure  
‚úÖ Built with **Groq‚Äôs Multimodal LLM** + **Whisper STT**

## üß† Modules Overview

### 1. `brain_of_doctor.py`  
- Uses Groq‚Äôs multimodal LLM to analyze the uploaded image + text prompt.
- Model: `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

### 2. `voice_of_patient.py`  
- Records the patient's voice using `speech_recognition` and microphone.
- Transcribes audio using Groq's Whisper STT (`whisper-large-v3`).

### 3. `voice_of_doctor.py`  
- Converts text response into voice using:
  - `gTTS` (free, offline)
  - or `ElevenLabs` (realistic voice via API)

### 4. `gradio_app.py`  
- Gradio interface for image upload + voice input
- Shows transcription, doctor's text reply, and audio output
